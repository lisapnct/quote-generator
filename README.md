This application was created as a submission to a [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges) challenge. The [challenge](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/8Y3J4ucAMQpSnYTwwWW8) was to build an application to complete the following user stories:
- I can see a random quote
- I generate a new random quote
- When I select quote author, I can see a list of quotes from them
- I can see quote genre under the author
